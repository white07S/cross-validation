# Cross validation of volatility measure and its drawback based on performance analysis
# Volatility: 
Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index.

Cross validation based on different volatility measure.
# 1.Garman Klass Volatility 
Garman and Klass assumed that the process of price change is a process of continuous diffusion (geometric Brownian motion). However, this assumption has several drawbacks.

# 3.Yang Zhang Volatility

# 4.Rogers-Satchell Volatility
Rogers-Satchell is an estimator for measuring the volatility of securities with an average return not equal to zero.
Unlike Parkinson and Garman-Klass estimators, Rogers-Satchell incorporates drift term (mean return not equal to zero).
